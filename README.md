1) hdu.gene_models.gff3 - Gene models in the genome predicted by the method described in the paper. Gene structure was predicted using Augustus and Genemark-ES, and then combined with additional evidence (PASA generated consensus transcript assemblies and alignment of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot proteomes to the genome) using EVM. 
2) hdu.proteins.fa - protein sequences corresponding to the coding regions of the genome.
3) Trinotate_report.tsv - Trinotate transcriptome analysis report.
5) pipeline_genome.sh - parameters for launching programs for processing, assembling and polishing the genome.
